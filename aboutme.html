    <p>Hello! My name is Camilla. I live in Chicago, Illinois and am a senior at Jones College Prep. I was born in Chicago but my father is from Colombia and my mother is from Argentina. My step-dad is from France. All of them were born in their respective countries.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>I love computer science and have studied it for a long time, but at an internship I started over the summer, I was able to experience the intersection of computer science and biology. Because of that and a previous interest in psychology, I am interested in being a psychiatrist or pediatric doctor who does research on the side using computer science!</p>
    <p>When I am older, I want to have two cats. Technically I am allergic to cats... however allergy pills work for me and I will persevere in order to fulfill my dream of having cats!</p>
    <p>I also want to travel all the countries in the world. The top at my list at the moment are Nigeria, Japan, Argentina, France, India, and Mexico.</p>
